# Presentation guidelines

This presentation was created using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), the HTML presentation framework.

In order to present, we spin a node.js server wrapped in a docker container:

## INSTALL

``` bash
npx reveal.js-online
```

A server will run on:

http://localhost:8001/

Use this page to build your presentation, using markdown.

Use [reveal.html](reveal.html) to style the presentation, using CSS.

Preview the presentation on:

[http://localhost:8001/reveal.html#/](http://localhost:8001/reveal.html#/)

Press `f` for full-screen and `s` for speakers notes.

## EXPORT

You can export the slide deck to pdf, by calling this url on your browser:
